	 * interfaces of the classes implementing the interface, and we don't want
	 * those. As for the related types, we should stick with the reverse inheritance
	 * relationship, and use the cumulative domain interfaces 2) for
	 * *_EXPLICIT_AGGREGATIONS, we should also use the local interface for the
	 * component because "reverse-inherited" could not be delegated to (they are not
	 * technically part of the API of the component), and won't show up anyway.

	/**
	 * This method looks for extents that look like {ClassA, SubclassB, SubclassC,
	 * SubclassD}, where ClassA survived the 'purge'. Remember that candidate
	 * features have their extents purged of classes that are NOT minimal with
	 * regard to the extension (or implements) relationship, because such classes
	 * would 'reverse inherit' the feature by virtue of their subclasses, and thus,
	 * should be eliminated. However, the purge keeps some classes that are NOT
	 * minimal IF AND ONLY IF they have their own implementations of the intent. An
	 * example of that is an abstract class with a bunch of abstract methods that
	 * are redefined by its extensions. Or, simply a regular class that defines a
	 * default behaviour, which is then redefined by its subclasses. These should be
	 * counted as multiple occurrences of the feature AND they were recognised as
	 * such by the developer.
	 * 
	 * Again, we have four cases, depending on whether: 1) the full extent is
	 * covered by such configuration: this distinguishes between FULL_EXTENT_* and
	 * PARTIAL_EXTENT 2) the full intent is covered by such configuration: this
	 * distinguishes between *_FULL_BEHAVIOR_* and *_PARTIAL_BEHAVIOR_*
	 * 
	 * For the partial/full intent, we use the intersection of the local domain
	 * interface of the anchorType (classA in the example above) with the cumulative
	 * interfaces of relatedTypes (classes SubclassB, SubclassC, and SubclassD in
	 * our example) as the basis for deciding between *_FULL_BEHAVIOR_* and
	 * *_PARTIAL_BEHAVIOR_*. We know that the intersection in question will be a
	 * SUPERSET of the intent. Thus, we want to know how much of that common
	 * behaviour is included in the intent, i.e. the ratio between the intent size
	 * and the shared behaviour size.
	 * 
	 * @param candidateFeatureNode
	 * @param featureType
