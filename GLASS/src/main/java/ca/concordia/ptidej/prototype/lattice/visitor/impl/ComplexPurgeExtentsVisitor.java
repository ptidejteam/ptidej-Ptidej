	 * get its ancestors 2) we compute the intersection between the ancestors
	 * and the extent 3) we remove the classes in the intersection from the
	 * extent-- and from further consideration by the method
	 * 
	 * Note that going from class to ancestors is more efficient than going from
	 * class to subclasses, for two reasons: 1) for most classes, there are more
	 * descendants than ancestors to look at 2) if the descendants of a class
	 * intersect with the extent, the only thing we know is that we must remove
	 * the class, whereas with the ancestors, I can remove all the ancestors in
	 * a single swoop
	 * 
	 * If the extent consists of a chain of n elements, by going from class to
	 * ancestors, on the average, I can hope to perform the test n/2 times. With
	 * the descendants, the worst case is the best case is n
